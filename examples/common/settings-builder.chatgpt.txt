I've developed NEAT evolve package for javascript. Now I'm trying to make example page html to show how evolving makes classification.
Help me create app based on react to manage settings for NEAT evolve settings.
Use DaisyUI framework to display controls.

This is requirements:
* All settings must be placed in 2 columns.
* All setting must have controller, label and description
* Use typescript
* Show only ready to use code example
* Use redux as state machine
* For common components create separate file for reusability
* This app must be applied to #settings-controller
* Show webpack config to build
* Show npm packages that I need to install with npm
* Generate description for settings based on your knowledge of neural networks and neat
* Do not install or import daisyui, postcss and tailwind. They are imported via html globally from cdn
* Do not show html code of index.html
* Webpack bundle file name: settings-builder
* Show file structure
* Your React app must be store in path: misc/settings-builder/
* In your code example always fully show code without cuttings
* I have no impicit any flag in tsconfig.json Always provide state type in your code
