I've developed NEAT evolve package for javascript. Now I'm trying to make example page html to show how evolving makes classigication. Help me to make changes:

Help me build beautirful and simple html page to represent example with classification.

General:
* Use daisyui v4.12 as framework
* Use theming and only daisyui components
* This page must be responsive and support pc and mobile
* Must have heading with info about this example
* Add short description about this example
* Add d3 from cdn

Points distribution:
* Page must contain container #points-distribution with min-width 400px and height 300px. This container will represent points distribution chart
* Must contain info about points distribution: correctly classified points with class 1 in #correct1-items, correctly classified points with class 2 in #correct2-items, not correctly classified points in #incorrect-items
* On big screen points distribution stats must be displayed on the right side of graph as column, on small screen display stats under the graph as row

Network graph:
* Page must contain container #best-network with min-width 400px and height 300px. This container will show network graph
* Must contain network fitness in #fitness
* Must contain network error in #error
* Must contain current evolving iteration in #iteration
* Must contain info about network configuration: input nodes, output nodes, hidden nodes, connections

Controls:
* Must contain buttons start, stop and resume. Start button must call js function setup()
* Move setup function call to button start click

Common:
* For points distribution chart and network graph use Card component
* From numeric stats use component Stat
* For daisyui use this links:
